# React Boilerplate

This boilerplate is built based on the concepts documented in the [foundations](https://github.com/desertsofcacti/react-js-overview/tree/foundations) branch.

This boilerplate is created from scratch using Webpack and Babel.

```
npm init -y && npm i react react-dom
```

This creates the following in `node_modules`

```
js-tokens
loose-envify
object-assign
prop-types
react
react-dom
react-is
scheduler
```

Create `.gitignore`

```
echo "node_modules\n.DS_Store\ndist"  >> .gitignore
```

Make an app folder and application structure

```
mkdir app && touch app/index.css && touch app/index.html && touch app/index.js
```
